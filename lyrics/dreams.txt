\f0\fs24 \cf0 Chorus:\
I wish that I could take a peak/\
Into my own future/\
I wish to know if I get what I seek/\
If my dreams come true/\
I wish that I could take a peak/\
Into my own future/\
I wish to know if I get what I seek/\
If my dreams will come true/\
\
Verse 1:\
Yeah, I often sit and wonder what my future holds/\
It\'92s like this empty space inside o\'92 me I wish that I could see/\
I\'92m workin so damn hard/\
It would be nice to know where I\'92m going and if my dreams are comin\
true/\
Another day has come and another night has been/\
Everythin is so damn fuzzy, what will the future bring/\
Will the sun be shinin brightly down on me/\
Will I be headin to the top and get the crown on me/\
Will I be ridin around in limousines with ma own driver/\
With a martini in my hand and all the shrimp I can eat/\
Will I be livin in a house with my own swimmin pool/\
Near the beach, with a chance of playin volley ball/\
\
Chorus:\
I wish that I could take a peak/\
Into my own future/\
I wish to know if I get what I seek/\
If my dreams come true/\
I wish that I could take a peak/\
Into my own future/\
I wish to know if I get what I seek/\
If my dreams will come true/}
